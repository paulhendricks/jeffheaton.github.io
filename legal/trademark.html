    <h1 id="encog-trademarks">Encog Trademarks</h1>

<h2 id="background-information">Background information</h2>

<p>The Encog trademark — i.e. the word “Encog”, whether or not in capitals — is owned and controlled by Heaton Research, Inc.</p>

<p>Although you are encouraged to use the Encog trademark (and the official Encog logo (official link to be included when released by Heaton Research, Inc.), which is itself a use of the Encog trademark) for your own purposes, you must first obtain a license. You can either obtain this license automatically, or through a license grant procedure, as further explained below in this policy.</p>

<p>This policy therefore first explains whether you receive an automatic license, or whether you need to obtain a license through the license grant procedure. In addition, this policy explains which “rules of use” apply when you use the Drupal trademark (whether you obtained the license automatically, or through the license grant procedure).</p>

<h2 id="why-this-policy-was-created">Why this policy was created</h2>

<p>This policy is based on the questions received by Heaton Research, Inc. from various persons and companies, and tries to cover the most typical use cases for the Encog trademark. By imposing simple rules, this policy aims to create a level playing field for everyone interested in using the Encog trademark.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-this-policy">Limitations of this policy</h2>

<p>Do not assume that this policy will answer every question you may have about the use of the Encog trademark. There will be scenarios where your intended use of the Encog trademark is not entirely covered by this policy, or where you have doubts as to whether or not a specific rule applies. In all these cases, you should contact Heaton Research.</p>

<h2 id="automatic-license-or-license-grant-procedure">AUTOMATIC LICENSE OR LICENSE GRANT PROCEDURE</h2>

<p>This section explains whether you are entitled to an automatic license (in which case you can use the Encog trademark without having to complete or receive any document), or whether you need to follow the license grant procedure. You will only be entitled to an automatic license when you are in any of the situations described under subsection A below, and not simultaneously in any of the situations described under subsection B below.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-an-automatic-license">Receiving an Automatic License</h2>

<p>You receive an automatic license when:</p>

<p><strong>Instance 1.</strong> You exclusively use the Encog trademark to either extend or improve the Encog software, or to encourage the use of the Encog software (in short “foster the Encog software” ).</p>

<p>Examples of “fostering the Encog software”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a course entitled “How to use Encog in your business” organized by a local non-profit organization;</li>
  <li>an open access monthly journal called “Encog Coding magazine”;</li>
  <li>an open source Apache plugin “JIT Compiler for Encog”;</li>
  <li>a freely distributed homebrew Encog theme “John’s Encog Christmas Theme”;</li>
  <li>a website “Encoghalloffame.com” with pictures of famous Encog contributors;</li>
  <li>administering a database with Encog bugs and corresponding workarounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples which do not qualify as “fostering the Encog software”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating a Encog fork “ImprovedEncog”;</li>
  <li>publishing a website “Encoghallofshame.com” with pictures of infamous Encog contributors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of not “exclusively to foster the Encog software”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a charitable organisation selling t-shirts with the Encog trademark to sponsor its fight against global warming;</li>
  <li>a company selling t-shirts with the Encog trademark, while donating 25% of the profits to the Encog Association.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Exclusively” means that any direct profits generated by using the Encog trademark, must also be exclusively used to foster the Encog software.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A high-traffic website “Encogindepth.com” containing sponsored ads, qualifies for an automatic license when the profits generated from these ads (minus hosting costs and other obvious costs incurred for maintaining the website) are used to pay a full-time developer working on the new open source Encog template engine.</li>
  <li>A Encog contributor wants to start a website called “newtoEncog.com”, with helpful tutorials aimed at people new to Encog. This website contains ads under the form of sponsored links, which would normally exclude the automatic license. However, because the referral code used for these ads is the Encog Association’s, any money earned goes directly to support the Encog project. Hence, this website can benefit from an automatic license. The New York Encog user group sells t-shirts with the Encog trademark to sponsor its functioning. This also qualifies for an automatic license.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instance 2.</strong> The Encog trademark is used in a domain name, title of website, title of a seminar, title of a course or title of a software package that is either exclusively intended to foster the Encog software, or also mentions your trademark (or your trade name, name of your company, name of your organization, or name of your association).</p>

<p>Example uses for which you receive an automatic license:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a course entitled “Acme’s Encog Gold Course” or “Acme’s Encog Certification Course” or “Acme’s Learn to Code with Encog “;</li>
  <li>a domain name that is used for commercial purposes and is entitled “Encogacme.com” or “commonusesofEncog.acme.com”;</li>
  <li>a domain name that is exclusively intended to foster Encog use, and is entitled “EncogUsersGroupCalifornia.org” or “EncogUnofficialFAQ.com”;</li>
  <li>an open source plugin to connect Acme’s SQL-server to the Encog software;</li>
  <li>a commercial plugin to connect Acme’s SQL-server to the Encog software, called “Acme’s SQL plugin for Encog”;</li>
  <li>a Encog course entitled “Encog 101” that is taught at a university;</li>
</ul>

<p>Example uses for which the license grant procedure must be followed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a commercial website hosted under domain name “commonusesofEncog.com”;</li>
  <li>a commercial course entitled “Encog Newbies Course 2009”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instance 3.</strong> The Encog trademark is used in the title of a book, newsletter, video, magazine or similar instructional instrument regarding Encog that does not suggest an “official link”.</p>

<p>Example titles for which you receive an automatic license:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Encog ninja secrets: the complete guide”, “Monthly Encog Bits”, “Encog in Depth”, “Encog Step by Step”, “John Smith’s Encog 6 Installation Guide”, “Illustrated Encog Guide”, “More effective ways to use Encog”, “Encog Screenshot Guided Tour”, “Beginning Encog”, “Encog inside out”, “Encog for network professionals”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example titles for which the license grant procedure must be followed, because an “official link” may be suggested by the title (see B.1 below):</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Encog 2”,</li>
  <li>“Official Encog Guide”,</li>
  <li>“The Encog Association’s Book on Encog”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instance 4.</strong> The Encog trademark is used for the title of a camp or meet-up.</p>

<p>Examples: “Encog Bootcamp 2009”, “Annual Encog Meeting”, “Encog Gathering New York”, “EncogCamp Antarctica”.</p>

<p>Note, however, that the license grant procedure must be used when the Encog trademark is used in combination with the words “conference”, “convention” or “association”. See examples below.</p>

<p><strong>Instance 5.</strong> You want to display the official Encog logo (whether for commercial or non-commercial use) in a standalone and unaltered form.</p>

<p>“Standalone” means that the Encog logo is not part of another logo. For example, a local Spanish Encog user group that would like to create a “Encog Spain” logo by extending the word “Encog” with the word “Spain” (in the same font and color), will not be entitled to an automatic license. “Unaltered” means that the Encog logo cannot be changed in any way — e.g., by changing the color, by slightly altering the shape of the letters, etc.
Examples for which you receive an automatic license: creating a banner that displays the Encog logo; using the Encog logo on your (commercial or non-commercial) website; displaying the Encog logo on product packaging; selling a t-shirt with the Encog logo printed on the back.</p>

<p><strong>Instance 6.</strong> Your intended use qualifies as “nominative fair use” of the Encog trademark, i.e., merely identifying that you are talking about Encog in a text, without suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Dries Buytaert or the Encog Association.
Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>describing a new Encog release in a review;</li>
  <li>referring to Encog in a comprehensive overview of content management systems;</li>
  <li>complaining in a blog about a missing feature in the Encog software;</li>
  <li>reporting about a Encog conference on your personal homepage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of the Encog trademark as part of the name of a function, procedure, variable name or similar source code component is also considered “nominative fair use” for which no license is required.
Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a procedure called Encog_add_link();</li>
  <li>a constant called Encog_AUTHENTICATED_RID;</li>
  <li>a variable named $Encog_tag;</li>
  <li>a set of source code files called Encog.module and Encog.js.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-a-license-grant-is-required-from-heaton-research-inc">When a License Grant is Required from Heaton Research, Inc.</h2>

<p>The license grant procedure must always be followed when you are in one or more of the following situations (even when you would also be in any of the situations under the previous section above).</p>

<p><strong>Situation 1.</strong> The use of the Encog trademark suggests an “official link” between your product or service and Heaton Research.
Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a domain name “EncogOfficialFAQ.com”;</li>
  <li>a domain name “EncogSupport.nl”;</li>
  <li>a company called “Encog Services Inc.”;</li>
  <li>a course entitled “Encog Exams”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Situation 2.</strong> The Encog trademark is used in combination with the words “conference”, “convention” or “association”, as well as any translation, abbreviation or variation thereof.
Examples: “Encogcon, “Encogconference”, “Encogconvention”, “Encog con”, “Encog conference”, “Encog Convention”, “Encog Association”.</p>

<p><strong>Situation 3.</strong> The Encog trademark is used as part of another registered trademark.
Example: a trademark “Encog Plugin Optimizer”.</p>

<p><strong>Situation 4.</strong> The Encog trademark is used as part of a “Encog.tld” domain name.
Examples: “Encog.com”, “Encog.info”,”Encog.co.uk”.</p>

<p><strong>Situation 5.</strong> The Encog trademark is used as part of a domain name that covers either an entire category of products or services that are relevant to the Encog community, that covers an entire target group of Encog users or that is otherwise too generic.
Examples for which the license grant procedure must be followed: “Encog-design.com”, “Encog-themes.co.uk”, “Encog-modules.com”, “Encog-support.nl”, “Encog-hosting.com”, “Encog-administrators.co.uk”, “Encog-tshirts.com”, “Encog-magazine.com”, “mobileEncog.com”, “Encog-intranet.com”, “Encog-services.com”, “Encog-development.co.uk”.</p>

<p><strong>Situation 6.</strong> The Encog trademark is used in a domain name, title of a website, title of a seminar, title of a course or title of a software package that is not exclusively intended to foster the Encog software, and this domain name or title does not also mention your trademark (or your trade name, name of your company, name of your organization, or name of your association).</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a “Encog Course for New Administrators” is organized by a local Encog community, the license grant procedure does not need to be used — even when a $600 registration fee would be requested — because the money earned is exclusively used to foster the Encog software;</li>
  <li>when the same course is organized by a commercial organization and not all of the profits earned are used to foster the Encog software, the license grant procedure must be followed;</li>
  <li>when the same course is organized by a commercial organization, but under the name of “Acme’s Encog Course for New Administrators”, the license grant procedure does not need to be used, even when none of the profits earned are used to foster the Encog software;</li>
  <li>when a commercial organization “Acme” has a product called “Encog River” that is not exclusively intended to foster Encog software, the license grant procedure must be followed;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Situation 7.</strong> The Encog trademark is used as part of the name of a company, organization, trade name or association.</p>

<p>Examples: a company named “Encog, Inc.”, “Encog Experts GmbH” or “Encog Support BV”; “Encog Hosting LLC”; an organization called “Encog Peru” or “Encog User Group Germany”.</p>

<p><strong>Situation 8.</strong> You want to use the official Encog logo in altered form or as part of another logo.</p>

<p><strong>Situation 9.</strong> There is any doubt as to how this policy should be interpreted or applied to a specific case.</p>
