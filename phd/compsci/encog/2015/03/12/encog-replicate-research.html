  <article class="post-content">
    <p>For the one of my PhD courses at <a href="http://cec.nova.edu/">Nova Southeastern University (NSU)</a> it was necessary to 
reproduce the research of the following paper:</p>

<p>I. Ahmad, A. Abdullah, and A. Alghamdi, “Application of artificial neural network in 
detection of probing attacks,” in IEEE Symposium on Industrial Electronics Applications, 
2009. ISIEA 2009., vol. 2, Oct 2009, pp. 557–562.</p>

<p>This paper demonstrated how to use a neural network to build a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system">basic intrusion detection 
system (IDS)</a> for the <a href="http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html">KDD99 dataset</a>.  It is important to reproduce research, in an academic 
setting.  This means that you were able to obtain the same results as the original 
researchers, using the same techniques.  I do this often when I write books or implement 
parts of Encog. This allows me convince myself that I have implemented an algorithm 
correctly, and as the researchers intended.  I don’t always agree with what the original 
researcher did.  If I change it, when I implement Encog, I am now in the area of “original 
research,” and my changes must be labeled as such.</p>

<p>Some researchers are more helpful than others for replication of research.  Additionally, 
neural networks are stochastic (they use random numbers).  Basing recommendations off of 
a small number of runs is usually a bad idea, when dealing with a stochastic system.<br />
Their small number of runs caused the above researchers to conclude that two hidden layers 
was optimal for their dataset.  Unless you are dealing with deep learning, this is almost 
always not the case.  The universal approximation theorem rules out more than a single 
layer for the old-school sort of perceptron neural network used in this paper.<br />
Additionally, the vanishing gradient problem prevents the RPROP training that the 
researchers from fitting well with larger numbers of hidden layers.  The researchers 
tried up to 4 hidden layers.</p>

<p>For my own research replication I used the same dataset, with many training runs to make 
sure that their results were within my high-low range.  To prove that a single layer does 
better I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance">ANOVA</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test">Tukey’s HSD</a> to show that differences among the different neural 
network architectures were indeed statistically significant and my box and whiskers plot 
shows that training runs with a single layer more consistently converged to a better 
mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation">RMSE</a>.</p>

<p>I am attaching both my paper and code in case it is useful.  This is a decent tutorial 
on using the latest Encog code to normalize and fit to a data set.</p>

<p>The class also required us to write up the results in <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE conference format</a>.  I am a 
fan of <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTex</a>, so that is what I used.</p>
