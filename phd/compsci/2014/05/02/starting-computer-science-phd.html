    <p class="post-meta">May 2, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I am starting a Ph.D. in <a href="http://cec.nova.edu/doctoral/cisd/index.html">Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.nova.edu/">Nova Southeastern University (NSU)</a>, in 
Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. A doctorate level degree is something I’ve considered on-and-off 
every since I earned my masters degree. I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence, 
and have read numerous peer reviewed articles as I constructed <a href="http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog">Encog</a> and wrote several 
<a href="/aifh/">books on AI</a>.  As I learn more about AI and Data Science I am beginning to see the 
frontiers of human understanding in these areas.  I would really to add a small bit to 
this understanding.</p>

<p>My goal for doing this is really to become involved in research– both independently and 
through my employer.  I currently work in “industry”, and I do not plan on changing that.<br />
I have worked as an adjunct professor, on a part-time basis.  Full-time academia is not 
something I am seeking in a Ph.D.</p>

<h2 id="my-criteria-for-a-program">My Criteria for a Program</h2>

<p>For my “day job” I work as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data scientist</a> for a large insurance company.  I am very 
active in the open source community.  I am a techie!  I love to program.  I love to 
figure things out!  This is why I have such a passion for AI and data science. There are 
a number of degrees that offer a blend of management with technology.  I have such a 
degree for my masters.  These degrees are fine, and offer a good balance.  But this was 
not what I was looking for in a doctorate.  I did not want to research how technology 
is applied to business.  I want to research technology itself.  Much as I have been 
already through open source contribution.</p>

<p>My criteria for a program were as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I want a doctorate level degree</li>
  <li>I do not want to move away from St. Louis, MO USA to pursue this degree</li>
  <li>I want exposure to peer reviewed publication</li>
  <li>I do not want to quit my job, or reduce to half-time while I pursue my degree</li>
  <li>I a degree that focused on technology, rather than management of technology</li>
</ul>

<p>I began my search late in 2013.  I evaluated a number of state schools, private 
universities and even the “for profit” institutions.  Most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_education">“for profit”</a> 
guys only had the management based degrees.  I really could not find computer science/engineering.<br />
There salesmen did try quite hard to convince me, and still call me.  But I really want 
a degree that ends with the word “engineering” or “science”, not “management” or 
“administration”. There is nothing wrong with such degrees, and I have great respect for 
them. I have certainly managed people before and worked in administration. But I don’t 
want to publish/research on “management” or “administration”.</p>

<p>So I applied to NSU, and after a few months, was accepted.</p>

<h2 id="why-nsu">Why NSU?</h2>

<p>NSU is a 2nd tier non-for-profit private university located in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.<br />
They have a traditional campus, with students living there. They also have a number of 
“distance learning” options.  I am pursuing a “distance degree”, and need to visit their 
campus four times a year.  There are certainly worse places to visit than Ft Lauderdale. 
This also works well, as my wife is pursuing a masters degree in Spanish.  Miami is very 
close to Ft. Lauderdale, and is a hub of Spanish speaking culture.</p>

<p>There are essentially three phases to a Ph.D. from NSU.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Course work, for breadth of knowledge (32 credits)</li>
  <li>Guided research (8 credits)</li>
  <li>Dissertation (24 credits)</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the approach of guided research before dissertation.  The courses cover topics that 
sound interesting to me.</p>

<p>Nova seems to be active in research.  They are in the process of building a <a href="http://cec.nova.edu/research/megalodon.html">super computer</a>, 
named Megalodon.  You can also see some of their <a href="https://gscisweb.scis.nova.edu/dlist/webview.cfm">dissertations here</a>.  Some of these 
dissertations, particularly in the area of computer science, sound like topics similar to 
what I might like to pursue.</p>

<p>I will start this fall.  I am beginning with two classes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CISD 760:  Artificial Intelligence</li>
  <li>CISD 750  Database Management Systems</li>
</ul>

<p>I am looking forward to starting the program, and seeing what the courses are like.<br />
I will travel to Ft. Lauderdale in August, for the first time.  I will write more about 
this as I continue the process.</p>
