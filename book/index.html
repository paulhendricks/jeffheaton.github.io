<p>We publish several books on neural networks in both Java and C#.  "Introduction to Neural Networks" teaches you the basics 
of neural network programming.  The focus is on understanding how to create neural networks from the beginning.  Once you 
understand the basics of neural network programming our "Programming Neural Networks with Encog" books teach you to use Encog, 
an open source neural network framework, to create more advanced neural networks.</p>

<h3>All AI ebooks by Jeff Heaton</a></h3>
This collection includes all AI ebooks written by Jeff Heaton.  This includes volume 1, 2 and 3 of the Artificial Intelligence 
for Humans Series, the C#/Java versions of the Encog book, as 
well as the Introduction to the Math of Neural Networks book.  This collection includes the individual ebooks.  
This collection is not offered in paperback form.</td></tr>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Vol 1: Fundamental Algorithms</a></h3>A great building requires a strong foundation.  This book teaches basic Artificial Intelligence algorithms such as dimensionality, distance metrics, clustering, error calculation, hill climbing, Nelder Mead, and linear regression. These are not just foundational algorithms for the rest of the series, but are very useful in their own right. The book explains all algorithms using actual numeric calculations that you can perform yourself.
Artificial Intelligence for Humans is a book series meant to teach AI to those without an extensive mathematical background.  
The reader needs only a knowledge of basic college algebra or computer programming?anything more complicated than that is 
thoroughly explained.  Every chapter also includes a programming example. Examples are currently provided in Java, C#, and R, 
although example packs for Javascript, Scala, Groovy, Python, Clojure, and F# are currently in the works.

<h3>Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Vol 2: Nature-Inspired Algorithms</a></h3>Nature can be a great source of inspiration for artificial intelligence algorithms because its technology is considerably more advanced than our own.  Among its wonders are strong AI, nanotechnology, and advanced robotics.  Nature can therefore serve as a guide for real-life problem solving.  In this book, you will encounter algorithms influenced by ants, bees, genomes, birds, and cells that provide practical methods for many types of AI situations.  Although nature is the muse behind the methods, we are not duplicating its exact processes.   The complex behaviors in nature merely provide inspiration in our quest to gain new insights about data.

<h3>Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Vol 3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks</a></h3>
Neural networks have been a mainstay of artificial intelligence since its earliest days.
Now, exciting new technologies such as deep learning and convolution are taking neural networks in bold new directions. In this book, we will demonstrate the neural networks in a variety of real-world tasks such as image recognition and data science. We examine current neural network technologies, including ReLU activation, stochastic gradient descent, cross-entropy, regularization, dropout, and visualization.

This book begins by showing how to calculate output of a neural network and moves on to more advanced training methods such as backpropagation, resilient propagation and Levenberg Marquardt optimization. The mathematics needed by these techniques is also introduced.
Mathematical topics covered by this book include first, second, Hessian matrices, gradient descent and partial derivatives. All mathematical notation introduced is explained. Neural networks covered include the feedforward neural network and the self organizing map. This book provides an ideal supplement to our other neural books. This book is ideal for the reader, without a formal mathematical background, that seeks a more mathematical description of neural networks.</td></tr>
